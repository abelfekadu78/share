Introduction:

The main purpose of education is to strengthen your mind so that you can more easily learn to deal with specific challenges you will face throughout your life. In order to succeed in academical education, it's important for students to have a firm grasp of each subject. There are many ways to do that.

Background:

Share is a website for students to share course materials so that new students improve their performance in a class by using documents other students shared. This will help students understand the materials and prepare for exams using the shared documents (quizzes, exams and individual/group assignments.)

Objective:

This website is aimed to help students as well as professors. It is needed to help students to learn from other studentâ€™s experience and prepare for exams or quizzes or projects ahead of time. It also help them decide to be registered in a specific class by looking at what kinds of course materials included. Documents shared in the website also help professors to prepare exams.

Procedures:

Users need to create an account in order to share any documents. When students upload a class material, they will also provide the name of the school and name of the class as well as name of the instructor so that new students can easily spot what class it is. the website also has a rating system so that students can easily spot the best possible search result.
